## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute by:

- Reporting bugs
- Suggesting new features or improvements
- Asking and answering questions
- Improving documentation
- Submitting pull requests

---

## Issues vs Discussions

To keep things organized, we use **Issues** and **Discussions** for different purposes.

### Issues (for actionable work)
Use an **Issue** when you have:

- A reproducible bug
- A feature request or enhancement
- A clearly defined technical task that likely leads to code changes

Please use the provided **issue templates** when opening a new issue.

👉 Rule of thumb: *Issues usually result in a fix, change, or pull request.*

---

### Discussions (for questions and conversation)
Use **Discussions** when you have:

- Usage or “How do I…?” questions
- General support requests
- Open-ended ideas or design discussions
- Requests for advice or clarification

Please post questions in **Discussions → Q&A**.

👉 Rule of thumb: *Discussions usually end with an answer or decision, not necessarily code.*

Issues that are primarily Q&A may be converted into Discussions by maintainers.

---

## Before Opening an Issue

Please check:

1. Existing issues (open and closed)
2. Existing discussions
3. Project documentation and README

This helps avoid duplicates and speeds up responses.

---

## Bug Reports

When reporting a bug:

- Use the **Bug Report** issue template
- Include clear steps to reproduce
- Describe expected vs actual behavior
- Mention relevant versions and environment details

Well-written bug reports are much easier to fix ❤️

---

## Feature Requests

When suggesting a feature:

- Use the **Feature Request** issue template
- Explain the problem you are trying to solve
- Describe your proposed solution if you have one

Feature requests are discussed openly and may take time to prioritize.

---

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are very welcome!

General guidelines:

- Keep PRs focused and small when possible
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Add or update tests if applicable
- Update documentation if behavior changes

If your PR relates to an existing issue or discussion, please link it.

---

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions.

We want pabot to be a welcoming project for everyone, regardless of experience level.

---

## Getting Help

If you’re unsure where your contribution fits:

- Open a **Discussion**
- Ask in **Discussions → Q&A**

We’re happy to help guide you in the right direction 🙂
